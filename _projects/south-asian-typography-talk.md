A talk exploring how the colonial history of printing in South Asia left deep typographic and design conventions that persist in contemporary practice — and what it might mean to begin decolonising design education and practice in the region.

## Central Question

When South Asian designers learned typography from European models — often literally from European textbooks and European teachers — they inherited not just techniques but value systems. What does European typography take for granted that South Asian typography cannot?

## Topics

- The history of colonial printing in South Asia and its typographic legacy
- How design education in South Asia continues to centre European typographic traditions
- The erasure of local script traditions in professional design contexts
- Examples of designers working explicitly against this grain
- A framework for thinking about decolonisation in design education
