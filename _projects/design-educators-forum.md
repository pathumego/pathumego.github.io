The Typography Educators Forum was organised to facilitate and inspire the development of techniques and exercises for teaching typography and typographic subjects within undergraduate design programmes.

## Aim

The forum was held in hopes of developing tools and methods for teaching typography in the context of execution and crafting at the undergraduate level in graphic and visual communication design courses.

## Format

Participants — graphic design educators from across Sri Lanka — were encouraged to actively engage with each other through a series of workshops, with the intention of:

- Developing or improving fundamental tools for teaching typographic execution and crafting
- Sharing successful exercises and pedagogic approaches
- Identifying gaps in typography education in Sri Lanka
- Building a network of design educators committed to stronger typography instruction

## Context

Typography education in South Asian design schools is often underdeveloped — heavily influenced by imported curricula from Europe that don't address local script needs, and often lacking specialist teachers. This forum aimed to begin addressing that gap from within the educator community.
