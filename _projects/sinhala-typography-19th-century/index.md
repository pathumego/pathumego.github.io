A research paper produced as part of the MA in Typeface Design at the University of Reading (2016), documenting the key typographic milestones in Sinhala typography during the 19th century in colonial Ceylon.

## Period Overview

The 19th century was a period of profound transformation for Sinhala typography. The introduction of mechanical printing presses by colonial powers, the work of missionaries and the eventual emergence of Ceylonese-owned printing establishments fundamentally reshaped how the Sinhala script was reproduced and read.

## Key Milestones

- The establishment of the first major Sinhala printing operations by Dutch and British missionaries
- The development of early Sinhala metal typefaces
- The influence of the Colombo Auxiliary Bible Society on standardising Sinhala type
- The emergence of Sinhala-owned newspapers and the demand for new typeface styles
- The gradual shift from calligraphic models to metal type conventions

## Significance

This period represents the foundational moment for Sinhala digital typography — many of the conventions (and problems) in contemporary Sinhala type design can be traced back to decisions made in 19th century foundries.
