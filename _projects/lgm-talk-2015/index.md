Two presentations at Libre Graphics Meeting — an annual conference for free and open-source graphics software:

- **LGM 2015, Toronto, Canada** — *"Jumping into Libre Graphics"* (remote presentation)


The 2016 talk examined the state of Indic script support in open-source software including Inkscape, Scribus, and GIMP — identifying gaps and opportunities for improving South Asian typography workflows in the libre ecosystem.
