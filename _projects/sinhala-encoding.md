Active contributor to Sinhala script encoding at Unicode and SLS1134 (Sri Lanka Standard 1134), and to Indic text rendering capabilities in open-source software including Libre Graphics tools.

This work ensures that Sinhala text is correctly encoded, stored, and rendered across operating systems, software, and web platforms — the invisible infrastructure that makes Sinhala digital typography possible.
