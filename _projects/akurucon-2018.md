AkuruCon was organised in collaboration with the Embassy of the Netherlands, Sri Lanka, to celebrate the 280th anniversary of the introduction of movable type in Sri Lanka.

## Background

In 1738, Gabriel Schade, a Dutch printer working for the VOC (Dutch East India Company) in Ceylon, established the first printing press with Sinhala and Tamil movable type. AkuruCon 2018, held 280 years later, was a celebration and examination of this founding moment in Sri Lankan print history.

## Programme

The conference consisted of several workshops and seminars focused on:

- The shared typographic history between Sri Lanka and the Netherlands
- The Dutch Press in Ceylon: type design, printing, and colonial context
- Contemporary implications of this heritage for Sri Lankan design
- Workshops on letterpress printing and type history
