A sustained commitment to building and maintaining free and open-source typefaces for Sinhala, Tamil, and other South Asian scripts — making quality typography available to everyone.

## Philosophy

Typography is infrastructure. In Sri Lanka and the broader South Asian context, the lack of quality free fonts for local scripts has historically meant that anyone without access to expensive proprietary software was shut out from professional typography. Free and open-source fonts change this.

## Contributions

- Developing and maintaining Sinhala fonts distributed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL)
- Contributing to font development tools and documentation for Indic scripts
- Participating in standards work at Unicode and SLS1134 (Sri Lanka Standard for Sinhala encoding)
- Contributing to leading open-source font development software

## Collections

Multiple font families published through Mooniak's open-source catalogue are hosted on GitHub and distributed via Google Fonts, Fontsource, and directly.
