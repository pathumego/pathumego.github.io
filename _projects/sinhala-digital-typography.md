A research survey assessing the state of Sinhala typography in digital environments — covering available typefaces, rendering quality, web font usage, and the infrastructure needed to support quality Sinhala typography on screen.

## Areas Covered

- Survey of available Sinhala typefaces for digital use (free and commercial)
- Quality assessment of Sinhala web font rendering across platforms and browsers
- Analysis of gaps: underserved typographic categories (display, serif, handwriting)
- Recommendations for improving the Sinhala typography ecosystem
- The role of open-source in building durable typographic infrastructure

## Context

At the time of writing, Sinhala digital typography was in a transitional state — moving from legacy non-Unicode fonts to Unicode compliance, and beginning to adopt web font technologies. This survey aimed to document that transition and identify priorities for the field.
