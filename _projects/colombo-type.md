description: Regular typography community meetups in Colombo — a space for letterform enthusiasts.

ColomboType started on one rainy Saturday evening in Colombo, when a room full of type aficionados of all shapes and sizes gathered, united by their love for typography. The common opinion was to provide a platform to share common interests, resources, and raise awareness regarding Sri Lankan typography.

## Format

ColomboType events are informal community gatherings — typically presentations, discussions, and workshops — held in Colombo for anyone interested in typography, type design, and letterforms.

## Topics Covered

Since its founding, ColomboType has opened space for discussions around:

- The currently extinct set of Sinhala numerals
- The anatomy of Sinhala letters
- The process behind logotype design
- Successful workshops on experiencing calligraphy
- Old Sinhala display type traditions

## Community

The ColomboType community became the informal heartbeat of the Akuru Collective — a recurring gathering where both new and experienced designers could engage with typography in a relaxed, open context.
