An article published in *Communication Arts* exploring how letterforms can serve as a medium for cultural reconciliation between Sinhala and Tamil communities in Sri Lanka.

## Argument

The article argues that the act of designing across scripts — particularly designing a typeface that inhabits both Sinhala and Tamil simultaneously — is not merely a typographic exercise but a political and cultural one. The shared visual space between Sinhala and Tamil letterforms offers a metaphor (and a practical tool) for finding common ground.

This was written in the context of post-war Sri Lanka, where reconciliation between communities was both urgent and unresolved. The piece examines how designers working with script and language can contribute to that conversation.

## Publication

*Communication Arts* (commarts.com) is one of the leading international design publications.
