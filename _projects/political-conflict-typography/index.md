A research paper examining the role of typography and visual language in shaping and reflecting the ethnic and political conflict in Sri Lanka from the mid-20th century onwards.

## Premise

Typography is never neutral. In a society where the same geographic space is contested by communities writing in two visually distinct scripts — Sinhala and Tamil — choices about which scripts appear in public space, on official documents, and in media carry profound political weight.

## Research Areas

- The Official Language Act of 1956 and its typographic consequences for Tamil script in public life
- How Sinhala typography was deployed as a marker of national identity in post-independence Ceylon
- The parallel visual cultures of Tamil Eelam and the Sri Lankan state
- The typography of propaganda, official documents, and civil conflict

## Relevance

This research sits at the intersection of design history, political history, and typography. It argues that understanding the Sri Lankan conflict requires attending to its visual dimensions — and that graphic designers have a responsibility to understand how their tools are entangled in politics.
