*Amma* is a hybrid typeface exploring the visual and cultural intersections of Sinhala and Tamil script letterforms. Developed as a graduation project at the Academy of Design (AOD), Colombo in 2013, it gained international attention from the regional design community.

## Concept

The Sinhala and Tamil scripts share a common geographic and cultural home in Sri Lanka, yet visually they appear quite distinct. *Amma* interrogates this assumed distinction — looking for the spaces where both writing systems can inhabit the same letterform simultaneously.

The word "Amma" (mother) is one of the most fundamental and shared words across both languages, a fitting title for a typeface that seeks common ground.

## Recognition

The project gained recognition from the South Asian design community and was featured in international design publications. It represented an early articulation of the multilingual design thinking that would later define much of the practice at Mooniak.

## Impact

*Amma* demonstrated that Sinhala and Tamil letterforms, while belonging to different script families, carry visual affinities that can be explored typographically — opening a space for design that honours both languages simultaneously.
