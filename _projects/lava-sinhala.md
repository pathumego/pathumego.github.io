Lava Sinhala VF is a variable font for the Sinhala script developed at Mooniak. It is one of the earliest implementations of the OpenType variable fonts specification for a South Asian script.

## About Variable Fonts

Variable font technology (OpenType 1.8, introduced 2016) allows a single font file to contain an entire family's worth of variation — weight, width, optical size, and more — encoded as continuous axes. For Sinhala script, this technology presents unique challenges due to the complex joining and stacking behaviour of the script.

## Design

The font supports a weight axis, allowing seamless interpolation between light and heavy weights. The design explores how variable font technology can serve the specific needs of Sinhala typography — particularly for display and branding contexts where expressive typographic control is valuable.

## Open Source

Lava Sinhala VF is published under a free and open-source license, contributing to the growing ecosystem of quality Sinhala typefaces available to designers and developers.
