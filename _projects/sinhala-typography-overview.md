---

A comprehensive survey of the development of Sinhala typography from the earliest manuscript traditions through to the digital era. Developed as part of BA research at the Academy of Design (AOD), Colombo, 2013.

## Scope

The survey covers:

- Sinhala script origins and its evolution through palm-leaf manuscript tradition
- The introduction of printing in Ceylon by European colonial powers (Dutch, then British)
- The 19th and 20th century development of Sinhala metal typefaces
- The transition to phototypesetting and digital type
- Contemporary Sinhala digital typography and the Unicode era

## Contribution

This overview serves as a foundational document for understanding the trajectory of Sinhala typography — a field that, at the time of writing, had very little published scholarship in English.
