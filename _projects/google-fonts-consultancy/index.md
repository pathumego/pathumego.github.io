From 2013 to 2015, worked as a consultant for the Google Fonts service with a focus on the Indian region. The role involved:

## Scope

- Reviewing and advising on font submissions for Indian and South Asian scripts
- Providing technical feedback on Devanagari, Sinhala, Tamil, and other Indic script fonts
- Contributing to quality standards for open-source fonts in the Google Fonts library
- Liaising with type designers in the region to improve the quality and coverage of South Asian scripts in the Google Fonts catalogue

## Context

This was an early and formative period for open-source South Asian script typography. The Google Fonts project represented a significant opportunity to bring quality Indic type to the web at scale, and the consultancy role helped shape that direction for the region.
