A series of knowledge generation and exchange projects aimed at exploring the shared cultural heritage between Sri Lanka and the Netherlands in the areas of typography, printing, graphic design, and type design.

## Historical Background

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) established significant printing operations in Ceylon. This included the development of Sinhala and Tamil typefaces for the Dutch Press — marking the beginning of typography for these scripts in the modern sense.

This project highlights the Sinhala and Tamil type-making and typography work by the Dutch Press in Ceylon in the 18th century, and examines what this shared history means for contemporary Sri Lankan and Dutch designers.

## Activities

- Archival research in Sri Lankan and Dutch archives
- Academic symposia and public exhibitions
- The Galle Font Project (digital revival of Dutch Press letterforms)
- Collaboration with Dutch institutions including the Embassy of the Netherlands
- Publications and documentation

## Significance

This project is part of a broader effort to make Sri Lanka's typographic heritage visible and accessible — and to build international scholarly and creative connections around that heritage.
