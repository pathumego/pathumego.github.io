A talk delivered at the Sri Lanka Design Festival examining the possibility — and the challenges — of building a viable font industry in Sri Lanka in the context of the country's economic crisis.

## Context

Sri Lanka entered a severe economic and political crisis in 2022. The question of how creative industries, and specifically type design and font licensing, could survive and even grow in this context became urgently practical.

## Key Arguments

- The global digital distribution of fonts means geography is less of a barrier than it once was
- Sri Lanka has a unique cultural asset: its scripts (Sinhala and Tamil) are underserved by the global type industry
- Free and open-source model vs. commercial licensing: both have roles to play
- Building community, education, and standards infrastructure is as important as producing fonts
- The Sri Lankan diaspora as a potential market and ally

## Conclusion

The talk argued that even in a bankrupt country, a fonts industry is possible — but it requires patience, collaboration, and a willingness to work at the infrastructure level, not just the product level.
