In partnership with FARU (Faculty of Architecture Research Unit), University of Moratuwa Sri Lanka, and the Akuru Collective, ATypI (Association Typographique Internationale) held their Working Seminars in Colombo on 22–23 March 2019.

## Significance

This was the first ATypI Working Seminar in 27 years, and certainly the first of its kind in the region with an exclusive focus on teaching typography. The fact that this globally significant typography event chose Colombo as its location was a testament to the growing profile of Sri Lanka in the international typography community.

## Theme

The main theme for the Working Seminar was the **teaching of typography and typeface design** in universities, colleges, and self-contained courses in the broader South and Southeast Asian region.

## Content

Participants came from across South and Southeast Asia to discuss:

- Pedagogy for typography and type design
- Challenges of teaching non-Latin scripts
- Curriculum development for design schools
- The relationship between professional practice and design education

## Organisation

Organised in collaboration with FARU, University of Moratuwa, and the Akuru Collective.
