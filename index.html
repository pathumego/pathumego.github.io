<p class="txt-2">
Pathum specializes in Sinhala and Tamil script typography and South Asian visual cultures. Based in Colombo, Sri Lanka, his practice sits at the intersection of culture and technology, 
spanning typography, typeface design, archival research, language technology, and community building.
</p>



<p class="hero-txt">
He is the founder and Managing Director of Mooniak, a type foundry and typographic design studio pioneering Sinhala+ Tamil multi script fonts and maintaining a large collection of Free and Open Source font projects. He co-founded Akuru Collective, a community and led events including  three major international typography conferences in Sri Lanka to inspire interest in letterforms and writing systems. He currently serves as the Chief Curator of the W A Silva Museum for Language, Literature and Typography in Colombo, working to preserve and make accessible Sri Lanka's language and typographic heritage. He teaches typography, talks about design and ponders about future of civilisation.
